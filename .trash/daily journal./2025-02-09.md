#daily_journal 

day started with me being woken up. was very groggy. had a bad nutella and bread breakfast again. doom scrolled until it was time to leave for mahogany. reached there. couldn't find an hdmi cable. but that is fine. went to eat sushi. was very good. i ate like 17 pieces. went to food court to meet adults. on the way there i saw the girl. she was sitting around a table at the center of the food court surrounded by plants.
she was pretty. had like clear rimmed glasses. couldn't see her face. after that we went back home. changed clothes and then started gaming. still playing albion online. some time later went to have dinner which was very a nice halim. afterwards went upstairs and finished the first mistborn book. finished writing journal at 2132.

---------------------------
a white girl. probably from some western country. she looked really good. a kind of nonchalant vibe to her.

no.

what must i do?

get better.
