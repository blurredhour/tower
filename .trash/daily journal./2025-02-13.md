#daily_journal 

today woke up at 0500 as usual. went to take a bath. came downstairs. cooked eggs for breakfast. came back upstairs. got ready for school. went to school. was quite boring as always but enjoyed playing that driver head game. saw my friends brother get into a bmw 430i. it was a really cool car. wonder why he got picked up in it. the ride back home was rainy and had a very angry bus conductor. reached home. doom scrolled until like 1730 which is way too long. need to cut down on screen time. at 1800 set up my trading. trading went well today. got slightly better at using the strategy. got food read book. read web novel. went to bed after night routine. finished writing journal at 2133.
