#daily_journal 

haven't written a journal for the past two days. today woke up. had breakfast. peanut butter and bread. doom scrolled for a while then got to playing eve online. finally managed to do an abyss run today.  ate lunch. played eve until a cluster shutdown. then started looking for games. didn't find any. pressed some clothes. just browsed youtube because there was a thunderstorm. talked with mamou until dinner. after dinner i just watched my phone until time to take bath. took bath. did night routine. went to sleep. finished writing journal at 2113.

don't waste your potential.

if you are meant for greatness doesn't mean you'll get it.
