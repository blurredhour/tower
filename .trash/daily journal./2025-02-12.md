#daily_journal 

today i got up ay 0339 for some reason. went back to sleep ofc. i finally had a good breakfast today. got ready. left for school. school was the usual uninterrupted chaos. came back from school. doom scrolled until like 1600. went to walk. got lost in the act as usual. came back from walking. watched my phone again. then set up my trading. didn't do much today. just looked at charts. went to have dinner. read mistborn 2 until time for night routine. went to sleep. finished writing journal at 2127.

the other side. not plagued by constant bad adminstration. reputable schools. people on my level that i can talk with. if i do not put in the effort now. what will become of me.
