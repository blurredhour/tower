#daily_journal 

today woke up did my morning routine. for breakfast ate 2 eggs as usual. got ready for school. for some reason kept thinking today was friday. left for school. school was pretty boring. someone did say that i looked happier today though. didn't do much. came back home. ate some snacks. learnt how traumatizing sids life must be. went for my walk. figured out this neat thing that runes have more efficiency if they are more specific. came back. felt that way too much time was spent between finishing my walk and starting to trade. made new ninja trader account today. this will be the one i will apply to the competition with. trading was fine just observed price action was pretty clean. went to get dinner. came back upstairs. watched some phone. completed the first maths paper of the year. finished a question i have never seen before. did night routine. went to sleep. finished writing journal at 2125.

i dont like studying the school syllabus.

but i have to do it.

i have to do things i don't like now. in order to do things that i like later.
