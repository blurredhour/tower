#daily_journal 

woke up a bit late today. alarm was off because of a stupid system update. so had a bath. got some nice breakfast. guacamole and eggs. got ready. went to school. school was fine. didn't do much because its a tuesday. at home. watched my phone until 1630. went for walk. was slightly harder today. goy back upstairs. watched phone until 1810. then started trading. the two screens don't seem like much of an advantage for my strategy. didn't understand the structure of the charts today. went down at 1915. ate a nice dinner. came back upstairs. optimized my phone for minimum youtube shorts. did night routine. went to sleep. finished writing journal at 2131.

you are a good person. be the good guy. be the chill guy. the spectator. give people what they want. it doesn't affect you. you're better that. act like it. get a fucking life bro. you think you're like them. you never will be. give the. the small wins. let them fuel their pride. you're better than that. you will win the war.
