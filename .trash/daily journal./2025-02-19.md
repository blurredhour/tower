#daily_journal 

woke up today at 0500. brushed my teeth. had breakfast. 2 eggs and bread. got ready for school. turns out it was useless because sports day qualifiers were taking place. spent the whole school day doing nothing but reading my book. got home. saw sid watching nonsense on the tv again. disabled yt in the settings but kids are way too smart nowadays. after that went upstairs. did something that i don't remember. went to walk. felt a weird kind of hunger or head lightness. came back. spent way to long looking at anti woke memes. got to trading. was too impatient. need to remember that i dont have to take a trade everyday. ate dinner. checked on my trade to see if i won. did some random stuff. read chronicles of narnia. did night routine. went to sleep. read [[rotrp]]. poor jalen. finished writing journal at 2127.

be always smiling. there are more reasons to smile than there are not to smile. be the better person. help them out even if you don't have to.

why?

because you are better than them. they might annoy you but don't get mad. they're just kids playing around. let them have their fun. no need for revenge or outrage. just have some fun. act better than what you are. maybe someday you really will be.
