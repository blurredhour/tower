The goal is to be able to use both hands with similar amount of dexterity. This in not only about making the left hand up to the standard of the right hand but also to be able to make both hands carry out orders of the brain effectively. This will be achieved through targeted training in specific activities with the hope that this can also help in all other activities.

These specific activities include:

- Brushing teeth
- Writing
