### ONGOING 

The goal of this experiment is to be able to understand advanced concepts in mathematics in a comprehensive way.

The start of this experiment will be to learn the content of [[Understanding Analysis - Stephen Abbott]] after which a future path will be decided upon if interest remains.

Interest does indeed remain but [[Understanding Analysis - Stephen Abbott]] has said that an important prerequisite is calculus and the ability to write proofs. For calculus the chosen book is [[Calculus made easy - Silvanus P. Thompson]].

A new path has been assigned to self-study mathematics and that is:

1. Algebra I - 
2. Geometry - 
3. Algebra II - 
4. Pre-calculus - 
5. Calculus - [[Calculus made easy - Silvanus P. Thompson]]
6. Analysis - [[Understanding Analysis - Stephen Abbott]]
