How to conclude that the square root of 2 is irrational?

if we assume that p and q are integers without any common factors and if there are any common factors then they have been factored out.

*(p/q)^2 = 2*

p^2/q^2 = 2

p^2 = 2q^2

now this states that p^2 is an even number and as that square root of an even number is always even then that means that p is also even. now if we write that

p = 2r 

and we substitute p into the former equation then we get.

(2r)^2 = 2q^2

4r^2 = 2q^2

2r^2 = q^2

now this proves that q^2 is even, even though at the start we said that there were no common factors between p and q. according to the book this means that the square root of 2 is irrational but how??
