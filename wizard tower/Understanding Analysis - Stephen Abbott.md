How to conclude that the square root of 2 is irrational?

if we assume that p and q are integers without any common factors and if there are any common factors then they have been factored out.
$$
\left (\frac{p}{q} \right)^2 = 2 
$$
$$
\frac{p^2}{q^2} = 2
$$
$$
p^2 = 2q^2
$$
now this states that *p<sup><i>2</i></sup>*  is an even number and as that square root of an even number is always even then that means that *p* is also even. now if we write that
$$
p = 2r
$$
and we substitute p into the former equation then we get.
$$
(2r)^2 = 2q^2
$$
$$
4r^2 = 2q^2
$$
$$
2r^2 = q^2
$$

now this proves that <i>q<sup>2</sup></i> is even, even though at the start we said that there were no common factors between *p* and *q*. according to the book this means that the square root of 2 is irrational but how??

the natural numbers are the normal numbers from *1* to *infinity* 
$$
\mathbb{N} = \{1,2,3,4,5,\dots\}
$$
now with the natural numbers math can be done perfectly well but in order to do subtraction you need to extend it to the integers which go from *negative infinity* to *positive infinity*. which are called the integers.
$$
\mathbb{Z} = \{\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3,\dots\}
$$
now this allows you to do subtractions as you have the necessary additive inverses  and allows you to have an **additive identity(which means that any number added to this is equal to itself)** which is *0* and *1* can act as the **multiplicative identity(any number multiplied by this is equal to the number itself)**.  but in order to do division you need the necessary multiplicative inverses thus the numbers are extended to the rational numbers where:
$$
\mathbb{Q}=\{\}
$$
all fractions *p/q* where *p* and *q* are integers and *q is != to 0*

A field is any set where addition and multiplication are well-defined operations that are commutative, associative, and obey the familiar distributive property :
$$
a(b+c) = ab+ ac
$$
There must be an additive identity and every element must have an additive inverse and multiplicative inverses must exist for all nonzero elements of the field 

Set **Q** also has a natural order defined on it. Given any two rational numbers *r* and *s*, exactly one of the following is true:
$$
r < s, \space r = s, \space r>s
$$
now if:
$$
r<s \space \& \space s<t \therefore  r<t  
$$
