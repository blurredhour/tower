The formula for derivative can be sourced from the formula for a gradient which is:
$$
m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}
$$
and as the derivative is taken as the infinitely small gradient it can be written as the gradient of the points $(x,f(x))$ and $(x+h, f(x+h))$ which substituted into the formula becomes:
$$
\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{(x+h)-x}
$$
$$
\frac{f(x+h)}
$$
