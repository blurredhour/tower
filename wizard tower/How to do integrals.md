An integral is calculating the area under the graph by cutting it up into infinitely small rectangles with the breadth being $dx$ which is a tiny part of x and the height being $f(x)$. and you just add them all together.
$$
\int_0^n f(x)dx
$$
The way to take an integral of something is the take its antiderivative. For example the derivative of $x^n$ is $nx^{n-1}$ and the antiderivative of $x^n$ is $\frac{x^{n+1}}{n}$
